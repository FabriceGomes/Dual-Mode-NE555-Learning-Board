# Dual-Mode-NE555-Learning-Board
A simple NE555 learning board with mono- and bistable modes, made for kids to solder, learn basics, and spark excitement for electronics.

This project presents a custom-designed printed circuit board built around two NE555 timer ICs, arranged to demonstrate two fundamental operating modes of the device. One NE555 is configured in monostable mode, while the second operates in bistable mode. Both circuits are designed to generate a visible one-second blink, making their behavior easy to observe and understand.

A deliberate design choice is the use of the J2 pin header as the trigger interface for the monostable NE555. Instead of implementing a mechanical switch, J2 allows the trigger to be activated using simple jumper caps. This keeps the board cost-effective, reduces mechanical wear, and makes assembly easier for beginners—while still letting participants experiment with trigger control.

The primary purpose of this PCB is educational. It was developed as a hands-on learning platform for children and teenagers, allowing them to solder the components themselves and explore basic electronics in a tangible, engaging way. By assembling the board, young participants learn about resistors, capacitors, integrated circuits, and how these elements interact to create timing functions. The contrasting modes of the two NE555s help illustrate how different circuit configurations lead to different behaviors, even when using the same building block.

Beyond its technical function, the project aims to spark curiosity and confidence in electronics through approachable, practical experience. The board’s layout is intentionally simple, robust, and visually structured to support beginners during assembly, troubleshooting, and experimentation. This combination of clear educational value, functional circuit design, and thoughtful cost-optimized features makes the PCB a versatile tool for workshops, maker events, and introductory electronics courses.
